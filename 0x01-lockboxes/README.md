# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Project Overview

This project involves determining whether a series of locked boxes can all be opened given a specific set of keys. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`, and each box may contain keys to other boxes. The task is to write a function that checks if all boxes can be unlocked starting from the first box.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of:

- Lists and list manipulation
- Graph theory basics and traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS)
- Algorithmic complexity (time and space complexity)
- Recursion
- Use of queues and stacks for graph traversal
- Set operations for tracking visited states

## Requirements

- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- Code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should be well-documented.
- All files must be executable.

## Tasks

### 0. Lockboxes

Write a method that determines if all boxes can be opened.

**Prototype**: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`

- `boxes` is a list of lists.
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
- Assume all keys will be positive integers.
- There can be keys that do not have boxes.
- The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked.
- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, otherwise return `False`.

**Example Usage**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```
